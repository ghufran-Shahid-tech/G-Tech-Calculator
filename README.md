## 📌 Project Overview

G-Tech Calculator is a front-end web application that replicates the functionality of a standard digital calculator.  
The project focuses on clean UI design, responsive layout behavior, and efficient JavaScript logic handling.

It demonstrates core frontend development skills including:

- DOM manipulation  
- Event handling  
- Conditional logic  
- Responsive CSS layout techniques  

This calculator works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices without requiring any external libraries or frameworks.

## 📝 Detailed Project Description

G-Tech Calculator was developed as a practical implementation of JavaScript fundamentals combined with structured UI design. The goal of the project is to create a fast, user-friendly, and visually appealing calculator that performs real-time arithmetic operations.

The application allows users to input numbers and operators either by clicking on on-screen buttons or by using their keyboard. The system dynamically updates the display area while processing mathematical expressions accurately.

The interface is intentionally minimal to ensure usability. Button spacing, alignment, and responsiveness are optimized for different screen sizes. Error handling prevents invalid operations such as dividing by zero or entering incorrect expressions.

This project strengthens understanding of:

- JavaScript expression evaluation  
- Event listeners and DOM interaction  
- Conditional logic  
- Responsive web design  
- UI/UX layout structure  

The calculator is lightweight, fast, and optimized for performance.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user clicks numbers or types via keyboard.
2. Input is captured through JavaScript event listeners.
3. The display updates dynamically.
4. When "=" or Enter is pressed, the expression is evaluated.
5. The result is shown instantly.

### Example Calculations

```
25 + 75 = 100
12 × 4 = 48
90 ÷ 3 = 30
```

## 📱 Responsive Design

The layout automatically adapts to:

- Desktop screens  
- Tablets  
- Mobile devices  

Buttons resize proportionally, and spacing adjusts to maintain usability on smaller displays.
